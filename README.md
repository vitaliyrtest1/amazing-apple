## Phase 2

In [phase 2](https://stackbit.com/docs/knowledge-base/building-with-components#phase_2) of the tutorial, `section_cta` and `section_cards` components have been built out, with placeholder text standing in for their subsections.

Clone the GitHub repostiory Stackbit created for you. You can find the link to your repostiory in the settings dialog.
Then, checkout the `preview` branch. Stackbit Studio uses this branch to show you the site preview.

```shell
git clone <created-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
git fetch
git checkout preview
```

Run the following commands to update the code:

```shell
cp -Rf phase2/ .
git add .
git commit -m "tutorial phase 2"
git push
```

Try any of these ideas:

* Add pages
* Add, remove, & reorder sections
* Add, remove, & reorder actions & cards
* Edit text on a page, in a section, or in an action/card

**Stackbit Studio tip**

Did you know you can navigate between pages of your site two different ways?

1. From the inline editor _(hover and click the diagonal arrow)_
2. From **Site Map** in the top navigation bar _(site map appears at left; click **Edit** at top to hide the site map)_

The site map provides a quick way to delete any pages you no longer need.


## Phase 3

In [phase 3](https://stackbit.com/docs/knowledge-base/building-with-components#phase_3) of the tutorial, we finished by adding `action` and `card` components.

Run the following commands to update the code:

```shell
cp -Rf phase3/ .
git add .
git commit -m "tutorial phase 3"
git push
```

Try any of these ideas:

* Add pages
* Add, remove, edit, and reorder sections
* Add, remove, edit, and reorder actions and cards

**Takeaway**

When you incorporate **lists of visual components** into your content model, you empower end users to unlock the full power of a Jamstack-ready interactive editing tool like Stackbit -- and through it, the full power of their creativity.
